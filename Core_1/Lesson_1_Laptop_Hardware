# Laptop Hardware and Components

## Internal Laptop Components

- **Motherboard:**
  - Smaller and custom-designed for each laptop model.
  - Lacks standardization, making replacement or upgrades challenging.

- **CPU (Central Processing Unit):**
  - Optimized for mobility, prioritizing power efficiency and heat reduction.
  - May be integrated (soldered) into the motherboard, limiting replacement options.

- **RAM (Random Access Memory):**
  - Uses SO-DIMM (Small Outline Dual Inline Memory Module) form factor.
  - Some models allow upgrades; others have RAM soldered onto the motherboard.
  - Compared to desktops, laptop RAM generally operates at lower voltages to conserve power.

- **Storage Devices:**
  - Uses 2.5-inch hard drives or SSDs, M.2 drives, or soldered flash memory.
  - Users often upgrade from traditional HDD (Hard Disk Drive) to SSD (Solid State Drive) to gain:
    - Faster boot times and data access.
    - Improved durability and power efficiency.
    - Lower heat generation and no moving parts.

## Laptop Input and Output Components

- **Keyboard:**
  - Custom-sized to fit the compact laptop chassis.
  - May include function (Fn) keys for secondary controls such as volume, brightness, or Wi-Fi toggle.
  - Some models include integrated pointing sticks.

- **Touchpad:**
  - Built-in pointing device, acts as a mouse alternative.
  - Multi-touch support varies depending on the model and driver.

- **Webcam and Microphone:**
  - Usually integrated into the top bezel of the screen.
  - Microphones may be placed beside the webcam or near the keyboard.
  - Often paired with physical shutters or kill switches for privacy.

- **Speakers:**
  - Built into the chassis, commonly near the keyboard or bottom of the laptop.
  - Provide stereo audio output.

## Wireless Connectivity

- **802.11 Wireless Standards (Wi-Fi):**
  - Most laptops support 802.11ac or newer Wi-Fi versions.
  - Provide wireless internet connectivity.
  - Internal Wi-Fi cards connect to **Wi-Fi antennas**, typically built into the screen bezel for optimal signal reception.

- **Bluetooth:**
  - Typically integrated with the Wi-Fi card.
  - Enables communication with peripherals like headphones, mice, or phones over short distances.

- **Wi-Fi Antennas:**
  - Located in the top cover of the display.
  - Connected via wires to the wireless card for optimal reception.
  - Their elevated placement improves signal strength and range.

## Peripheral Communication and Security Features

- **Biometrics:**
  - Includes fingerprint readers and facial recognition sensors.
  - Used for authentication and system access, often integrated into the palm rest or power button.

- **Near Field Communication (NFC):**
  - Enables short-range data exchange (usually less than 10 cm).
  - Can be used for quick file transfers, authentication, or pairing with other NFC devices.

## Power and Battery

- **Battery Types:**
  - **Lithium-Ion (Li-ion):**
    - Most common.
    - Good energy density and lifespan.
    - Requires circuitry to avoid overcharging.
  - **Lithium-Ion Polymer (LiPo):**
    - Allows for thinner and lighter designs.
    - More flexible in shape but generally more fragile and expensive.

## Expandability and Docking

- **Docking Stations:**
  - External accessories that expand connectivity options (e.g., USB, Ethernet, DisplayPort).
  - Ideal for turning laptops into full desktop setups in office environments.

- **Upgradable Components:**
  - RAM (if not soldered).
  - Storage (2.5-inch SSD/HDD or M.2).
  - Wireless card (in some models).
